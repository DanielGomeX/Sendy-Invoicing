SENDY INVOICING - ADMINISTRATOR INVOICE PREVIEW ADD-ON

This is an optional modification that is not included in the install.
Inserting this block gives the administrator account a "Generate invoice"
button on the send screen and interrupts the send with an alert box
once if the invoice button has not been clicked.

This modification is not included in the install because it interrupts
user experience and does not serve a purpose in most Sendy installs.
You may wish to add this if your administrator account is used for
sending emails on other brands' behalf.

The contents of this file should be pasted into send-to.php. Look for the
section around lines 443-444 that look like this:

	<input type="hidden" id="aws_keys_available" value="...
	<button type="submit" class="btn btn-inverse btn-large"...

The contents of this file should appear immediately after the input and
before the button.
